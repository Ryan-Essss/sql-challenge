### Background
It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

### Technologies
- pgAdmin
- postgreSQL 11
- quickdatabasediagrams.com

### Scope of Work

##### Data Modeling
Inspected CSVs and created and ERD of the tables.

##### Data Engineering
Created a table schema for each of the six CSV files using Primary, Composite, and Foreign Keys.  Imported
all CSV files into the corresponding SQL table.
